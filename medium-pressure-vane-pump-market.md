<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medium Pressure Vane Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Displacement</li><li>Variable Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The medium pressure vane pump market consists of two main types: fixed displacement and variable displacement pumps. Fixed displacement pumps operate at a constant flow rate, meaning the amount of fluid pumped remains the same regardless of the system's demand. On the other hand, variable displacement pumps allow the flow rate to be adjusted according to the system's requirements, offering greater flexibility. Both types cater to different needs, with fixed displacement pumps being suitable for applications with a constant flow demand, while variable displacement pumps are ideal for systems that require adjustable flow rates.</p></p>
