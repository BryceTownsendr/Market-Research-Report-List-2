<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Remover Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Type</li><li>Negative Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The photoresist remover market is categorized into two types: positive type and negative type. In the positive type market, photoresist is used as a protective layer, which is exposed to UV light to harden and create desirable patterns. The remover then selectively dissolves the unexposed areas, leaving behind the desired pattern. On the other hand, the negative type market involves using photoresist as a non-hardening layer. The remover is used to dissolve the exposed portions, leaving behind the desired pattern. These types cater to different manufacturing needs in industries such as electronics and printing.</p></p>
