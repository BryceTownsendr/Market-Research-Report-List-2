<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shortwave Infrared Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cooled</li><li>Uncooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) market can be categorized into two types: Cooled and Uncooled. In the Cooled market, SWIR cameras employ a cooling system such as a thermoelectric cooler to reduce the sensor's temperature, improving sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratios. Cooled cameras are typically used in applications requiring high-resolution imaging and superior performance. On the other hand, Uncooled SWIR cameras do not have a cooling system, making them more cost-effective, compact, and suitable for applications where lower performance is acceptable, such as surveillance and monitoring.</p></p>
