<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Building Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastics</li><li>Thermosetting Plastics</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Building plastics are materials used in construction that offer durability, flexibility, and resistance to weathering and chemicals. They can be categorized into two main types: thermoplastics and thermosetting plastics. </p><p>Thermoplastics are plastic materials that can be melted and re-molded multiple times without losing their properties. They can be easily reshaped and recycled, making them versatile and cost-effective for construction purposes.</p><p>On the other hand, thermosetting plastics are materials that undergo a permanent chemical change when heated, resulting in a hardened state that cannot be re-molded. These plastics offer high resistance to heat, corrosion, and electrical conductivity, making them suitable for applications such as electrical insulation or components that require stability under extreme conditions.</p></p>
