<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 2 Box Metal Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electromagnetic Induction</li><li>X-ray</li><li>Microwave</li></ul></p>
<p><p>There are two main types of metal detectors used in the market: electromagnetic induction and X-ray/microwave detectors.</p><p>Electromagnetic induction metal detectors work by generating a magnetic field, which interacts with any metal object nearby and produces an electrical signal. These detectors are commonly used in industries such as mining and security screening, as they can easily detect metal objects even if they are buried or hidden.</p><p>X-ray and microwave metal detectors use radiation to identify metal objects. X-ray detectors emit high-energy X-rays that pass through objects and create an image based on the level of radiation absorbed. Microwave detectors, on the other hand, emit microwave signals that bounce off metal objects and create distortions in the signal, which can be detected. These types of detectors are primarily used in airport security checkpoints and industrial settings where more precise identification is required.</p></p>
