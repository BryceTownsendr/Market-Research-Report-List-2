<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smoke Barriers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ActiveType</li><li>PassiveType</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Smoke barriers are essential safety measures in buildings to control the spread of smoke during a fire. Active-type smoke barriers use mechanical devices, such as smoke exhaust fans or smoke barriers doors, to prevent smoke from spreading. Passive-type smoke barriers, on the other hand, are constructed using fire-resistant materials and do not require any mechanical intervention to function. They form physical barriers that limit the movement of smoke through walls, floors, or ceilings. Both types play vital roles in safeguarding occupants and enabling safe evacuation during a fire emergency.</p></p>
