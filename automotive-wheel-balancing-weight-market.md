<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Wheel Balancing Weight Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Clip-On Type</li><li>Adhesive Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive wheel balancing weight market consists of two main types: clip-on type and adhesive type. Clip-on type wheel balancing weights are attached by clipping them onto the rim of the wheel. They are easy to install and remove, making adjustments simple. On the other hand, adhesive type wheel balancing weights are applied using adhesive backings, which firmly stick to the wheel's surface. They provide a strong bond and are less likely to detach, ensuring long-term stability. Both types have their advantages, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of the vehicle and the preferences of the user.</p></p>
