<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Fog Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Foggy Guard Coating (FGC)</li><li>Defog Coating (DFC)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anti-fog coatings are used to prevent the formation of fog on various surfaces. The market for these coatings can be divided into two types - Foggy Guard Coating (FGC) and Defog Coating (DFC). FGC involves applying a hydrophilic coating that causes water droplets to spread evenly on the surface, preventing fog from forming. On the other hand, DFC works by creating a thin layer that prevents fog from adhering to the surface. Both types of coatings are effective in reducing fogging and improving visibility on different surfaces.</p></p>
