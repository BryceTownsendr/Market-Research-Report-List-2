<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stress Gauge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Blind Hole Method</li><li>Ring Core Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Stress Gauge market offers two different types: the Blind Hole Method and the Ring Core Method. The Blind Hole Method involves drilling a hole into a material and inserting a stress gauge to measure stress levels. This method is useful when the surface of the material cannot be accessed directly. On the other hand, the Ring Core Method involves placing a stress gauge inside a ring-shaped core, which is then compressed to measure stress. This method is suitable for measuring stress in materials that can be easily deformed.</p></p>
