<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti Set-Off Powders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coated Type</li><li>Regular Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anti-setoff powders are used in printing to prevent ink from smudging or transferring onto other surfaces. Coated type anti-setoff powders are made of fine particles that are coated with a special material, providing improved performance and reduced dusting. They offer better ink absorption and provide a smoother finish on printed materials. Regular type anti-setoff powders, on the other hand, are made up of regular particles without any coating. They are more commonly used in basic printing applications and may result in higher dust levels compared to coated type powders.</p></p>
