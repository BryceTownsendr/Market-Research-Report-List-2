<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiomyopathy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dilated cardiomyopathy</li><li>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</li><li>Restrictive cardiomyopathy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiomyopathy is a term used to describe diseases of the heart muscle. There are three main types: dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by a weakened and enlarged heart, leading to decreased pumping efficiency. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy involves the thickening of the heart muscle, making it harder for the heart to relax and fill with blood. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is marked by stiffness of the heart muscle, causing impaired heart relaxation and filling. Understanding these market types helps in developing targeted treatments for patients with different cardiomyopathy conditions.</p></p>
