<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RF Power Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorption Type Power Meter</li><li>Through Type Power Meter</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The RF power meter market consists of two main types: absorption type and through type power meters. Absorption type power meters use a directional coupler to take a small portion of the input signal and divert it to a detector, which then measures the power level. Through type power meters, on the other hand, allow the entire signal to pass through to the detector. Both types measure RF power levels accurately, but the choice depends on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
