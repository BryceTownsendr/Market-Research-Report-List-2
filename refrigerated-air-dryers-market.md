<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refrigerated Air Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cycling</li><li>Non-cycling</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Refrigerated air dryers are used to remove moisture from compressed air in various industrial applications. There are two main types of refrigerated air dryers: cycling and non-cycling. </p><p>Cycling refrigerated air dryers operate by cycling the refrigeration compressor on and off to maintain a consistent dew point temperature. This type of dryer is energy-efficient as it only operates when needed, reducing overall energy consumption.</p><p>On the other hand, non-cycling refrigerated air dryers continuously run the refrigeration compressor regardless of the actual demand for dry air. While these dryers may consume more energy compared to cycling ones, they often have a lower initial cost.</p><p>Both types of refrigerated air dryers have their own advantages and considerations depending on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
