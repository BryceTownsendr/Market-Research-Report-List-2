<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Drop Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Mode Cable</li><li>Multi Mode Cable</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The flat drop cable market consists of two main types: single mode cable and multi-mode cable. Single mode cable is designed for long-distance communication and uses a narrow core which allows only one mode of light to propagate. It provides higher bandwidth and is suitable for applications requiring high speed and longer transmission distances. On the other hand, multi-mode cable uses a larger core that allows multiple modes of light to propagate simultaneously. It is typically used for shorter transmission distances and provides lower bandwidth compared to single mode cable.</p></p>
