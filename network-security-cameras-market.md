<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Network Security Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized IP Cameras</li><li>DeCentralized IP Cameras</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Network security cameras are classified into two types - centralized IP cameras and decentralized IP cameras. Centralized IP cameras require a central Network Video Recorder (NVR) or server to process and store the video footage. They rely on a single point of control and offer centralized management and recording capabilities. On the other hand, decentralized IP cameras have built-in processing and storage capabilities, eliminating the need for a central NVR. They operate independently and can transmit footage directly to external storage or the cloud.</p></p>
