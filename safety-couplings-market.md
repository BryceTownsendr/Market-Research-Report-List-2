<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Safety Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Safety Couplings for Indirect Drives</li><li>Safety Couplings for Direct Drives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Safety couplings are devices used to protect machinery from overload or unforeseen torque spikes. There are two main types of safety couplings: ones designed for indirect drives and ones designed for direct drives. Safety couplings for indirect drives are typically used in situations where the driven and driving elements are separated. They provide protection by disconnecting the driving element from the driven element in the event of excessive torque. Safety couplings for direct drives, on the other hand, are used when the driving and driven elements are directly connected, providing instant disconnection in case of overload or torque spikes.</p></p>
