<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti Static Ionizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type Ionizer</li><li>Induction Type Ionizer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Anti Static Ionizer market includes two main types: Contact Type Ionizer and Induction Type Ionizer. Contact Type Ionizers work by producing ions through direct contact with an object, which neutralizes the static charge. On the other hand, Induction Type Ionizers generate ions without physically touching the surface, relying on the principle of electromagnetic induction. Both types effectively eliminate static electricity, but Contact Type Ionizers are more suitable for smaller objects, while Induction Type Ionizers are ideal for larger areas that require frequent movement.</p></p>
