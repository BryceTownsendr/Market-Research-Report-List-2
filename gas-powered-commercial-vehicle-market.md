<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Powered Commercial Vehicle Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CNG Vehicle</li><li>LNG Vehicle</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gas-powered commercial vehicle market comprises two main types: Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) vehicles and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) vehicles. CNG vehicles use natural gas stored at high pressure, while LNG vehicles use natural gas cooled to a liquid state. Both types offer environmental benefits, emitting lower levels of pollutants compared to traditional gasoline or diesel vehicles. CNG vehicles are more common and suitable for shorter distances, while LNG vehicles, due to the higher energy density of liquefied gas, are preferred for longer journeys. These alternative fuel options are gaining popularity in the commercial vehicle market due to their lower carbon emissions.</p></p>
