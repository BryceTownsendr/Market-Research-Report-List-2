<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Epoxy Based Electrically Conductive Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Isotropic</li><li>Anisotropic</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Epoxy based electrically conductive adhesives are used in various applications where electrical conductivity is required, such as bonding electrical components. Isotropic conductive adhesives have conductive particles uniformly distributed within the adhesive, allowing electrical conduction in all directions. These are commonly used for low-density electrical interconnects. On the other hand, anisotropic conductive adhesives have conductive particles aligned in one direction, enabling electrical conduction in that specific direction. Anisotropic conductive adhesives are often utilized in high-density electrical interconnects, such as fine-pitch flip-chip bonding, where precision alignment is crucial.</p></p>
