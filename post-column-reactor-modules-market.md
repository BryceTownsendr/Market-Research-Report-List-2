<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Post-Column Reactor Modules Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Reaction Core</li><li>Double Reaction Core</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Post-column reactor modules are used in analytical chemistry to derivatize or modify analytes before they are detected by a detector. These modules are available in two types: single reaction core and double reaction core. </p><p>In single reaction core modules, only one derivatization reaction can be carried out at a time. This limits the flexibility of the system but can be suitable for simple applications.</p><p>On the other hand, double reaction core modules have two reaction cores, enabling simultaneous or sequential derivatization reactions. This offers increased flexibility and the ability to perform more complex analyses.</p></p>
