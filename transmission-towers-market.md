<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transmission Towers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hanging Tower</li><li>Resisting-Tensile Tower</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transmission towers are essential infrastructure for transmitting electricity from generating stations to distribution networks. Two common types are Hanging Towers and Resisting-Tensile Towers. Hanging Towers are suspended from overhead wires, ensuring stability with their weight and enabling them to withstand heavy loads. Resisting-Tensile Towers, on the other hand, rely on tension in guy wires to resist the forces of wind and gravity. They are designed to be lighter and more flexible, providing cost-effective solutions for transmission systems with high stability and load-bearing capabilities.</p></p>
