<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Exterior Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-Component</li><li>Two-Component</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive exterior adhesives market can be categorized into two types: one-component and two-component adhesives. One-component adhesives are premixed and ready-to-use, eliminating the need for measuring or mixing. These adhesives cure when exposed to moisture or heat. On the other hand, two-component adhesives require separate mixing of two different components, typically resin and hardener, before application. These adhesives offer a longer working time as the curing process is initiated only after mixing. Both types of adhesives are widely used in automotive applications for bonding exterior components.</p></p>
