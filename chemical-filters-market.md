<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Activated Carbon Filters</li><li>Ion-exchange Resin Filters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chemical filters, such as activated carbon filters and ion-exchange resin filters, are used to remove impurities and contaminants from air or water. Activated carbon filters work by adsorbing pollutants onto the surface of the carbon material, thus trapping them. Ion-exchange resin filters, on the other hand, remove contaminants by exchanging ions with the impurities in the water and retaining them within the resin. Both types of filters are effective in improving the quality of air and water, providing cleaner and safer environments.</p></p>
