<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The GaN CMP Pads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hard Pads</li><li>Soft Pads</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The GaN CMP (Chemical Mechanical Planarization) pads market consists of two main types: hard pads and soft pads. Hard pads are made from rigid materials like polyurethane and offer high durability and resistance to wear and tear. They are typically used for aggressive polishing and provide efficient material removal. On the other hand, soft pads are made from materials like non-woven fabric and offer better conformability to the substrate. They are used for finer polishing and provide lower defectivity and better planarization. Both types of pads play a crucial role in achieving desired GaN device performance.</p></p>
