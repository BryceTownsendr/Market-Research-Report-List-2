<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pumps for Desalination Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pumps for desalination market consists of two main types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize kinetic energy to move fluids and are most commonly used in larger desalination plants due to their high flow rate capability. On the other hand, positive displacement pumps deliver a fixed volume of fluid per cycle and are suitable for smaller desalination systems that require precise control and handling of fluids. Both types play a crucial role in the desalination process by providing the necessary pressure to push seawater through membranes for salt removal.</p></p>
