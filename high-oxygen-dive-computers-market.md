<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-oxygen Dive Computers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LED Color Display</li><li>Colorless Display</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High-oxygen dive computers include two types of display: LED color display and colorless display. LED color display dive computers use light-emitting diodes to showcase information with vivid and easily distinguishable colors, enhancing readability underwater. On the other hand, colorless display dive computers lack color output, relying on a grayscale or monochrome display. Both types allow divers to view critical data such as depth, time, and decompression limits, but LED color display computers offer a more visually appealing and intuitive interface compared to colorless display computers.</p></p>
